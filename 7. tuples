tuples : order collection of objects.
Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses () instead of square brackets [].
tuples, list and range belongs to sequences type.
lists are mutable where as tuples are immutable , but tuples contains mutable objects.

Ex : 
  t = 12345, 54321, 'hello'
  print(t[0])
  print(t)

Ex : tuples are immutable , you cannot replace element, append or delete an element.
  t = 12345, 54321, 'hello'
  t[0] = 4545
  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
  
  
Ex : tuples may be nested
  t = (1,2,3), (4,5,6)
  print(t
  # ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))
  
  
Ex : tuples can contain mutable objects , example using lists, lists are mutable
  list1 = [1,2,3]
  list2 = [4,5,6]
  t = (list1,list2)
  print(t)            # ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
  t[0].append(99)
  print(t)            # ([1, 2, 3, 99], [4, 5, 6])
  
  
  
Ex : creating tuple with single element
  # to create a tuple with single element
  p = "this is not a tuple"
  t = "i am tuple",	#note trailing comma
  print(type(t))      # <type 'tuple'>
  
  
 Ex : empty tuple
    empty = ()    
    print(type(emtpy))  # <type 'tuple'>
    
    
 Ex : unpacking tuple
 
  t = (5, 10, 15)	    # packing tuple
  (x ,y , z) = t      # unpacking tuple
  print('x',x)
  print('y',y)
  print('z',z)
  
  
  ****************************************************************************
  
  as of 3.6 python , tuple has two functions count() and index()
  
  t = (2,3,2,4,5)
  print(t.count(2))       # number of appearence of element 2 is 2
  print(t.index(2))       # index of (first appearing)element 2 is 0
