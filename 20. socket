Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. 
They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). 

Sockets allow communication between two different processes on the same or different machines.


The primary socket API functions and methods in this module are:

    socket()
    bind()
    listen()
    accept()
    connect()
    connect_ex()
    send()
    recv()
    close()

  To send message on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) , use constants below

  socket.AF_INET :
  socket.SOCK_STREAM :  
  
  Address Families :
  AF_INET : to connect remote host
  AF_UNIX : interact with host/same system
  
  communication semantics
   SOCK_STREAM - sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based byte streams
   SOCK_DGRAM - datagrams which is connectionless, unreliable messages of a 
                  fixed (typically small) maximum length
                  
                  
                  
  steps to create server : 
  socket - bind - listen - accept - rec/send - close
  
  steps to create client :
  socket - connect - send/rec - close
