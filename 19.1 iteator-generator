iter() : iterate elements one by one , cannot be customized

list = [1,2,3]
it = iter(list)
print(it.__next__())
print(it.__next__())
print(it.__next__())


# output :
#  1
#  2
#  3




generator : similar to iterator  and can be customized as well, to iterate generator uses yield keyword

# iterator element by multiplying by number 5
list  = [1,2,3]


def generator():
    for i in list:
        yield i * 5


gen = generator()
print(gen.__next__())
print(gen.__next__())
print(gen.__next__())

# output : 
5
10
15
