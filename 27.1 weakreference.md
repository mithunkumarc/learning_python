##### reference count : how many variable pointing to same object
##### when you create a strong reference, reference count of obj increases by 1
##### weak references doesn't increases reference count by 1
##### objects pointing by strong references cannot get garbage collected
##### use weakreference for expensive objects. (which takes more memory)


        import sys

        sys.getrefcount(a)

        b = a

        l = [1,2,3,a]

        gc.collect()    # removes unrefernced objects
