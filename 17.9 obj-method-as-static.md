#### object method can be accessed as static method , if that method does not uses object properties


      class Person:
          count = 0
          def __init__(self):
              self.name = 'rajat'

          def speak(self):
              return f'my name is {self.name}'


          def run(self):
              return 'a person running'

      print(Person.run(Person))   # works : treating instance method run as static method
      # accessing object method in static context
      print(Person.speak(Person)) # fails : cannot be treated as instance method as it access object property

#### method vs function

        method : it is function which is attached to object as behaviour
        eg : 
              class  Person:
                    def speak(self):
                            print('speak')
                         
              p = Person()           
              print(type(p.speak))
              
              output : class method
              
              
        function : individual function belongs to class function
        
        
#### two ways to call python method

                class Person:
                    count = 0
                    def __init__(self,name):
                        self.name = name

                    def speak(self):
                        print(f'my name is {self.name}')


                p = Person('rajat')

                # first way
                p.speak()
                # second way
                Person.speak(p)
