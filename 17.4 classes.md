#### overloading and overriding


#### __init__ function, if you have declared two init funtion, second init function will be considered

            class Student:
                def __init__(self,name):
                    print('first')
                    self.name = name

                def __init__(self,name):
                    print('second')
                    self.name = name


            s= Student('jim')
            print(s.name)

            ouput : second 
                    jim

#### overloaded init function : 
###### init functions are not inherited


                class Student:
                    #below init function , accepts name alone 
                    # and as well as name and idcard both
                    def __init__(self,name,idcard=None):
                        self.name = name
                        if idcard != None:
                            self.idcard = idcard


                s1 = Student('jim')
                print('only name',s1.name)
                s2 = Student('amy',53)
                print('both name and age',s2.name,s2.idcard)

                output :  
                only name jim
                both name and age amy 53

#### overloaded methods

                class Student:
                    def method(self,a,b=None):      #accepts value of a alone and also together with b
                        print('a',a)
                        if b != None:
                            print('b',b)
                        print('*******')


                s= Student()  
                s.method(4)       3 sending only a
                s.method(3,4)     # sending both a and b


                output :
                'a' 4
                
                'a' 3
                'b' 4

#### overriding methods 


                # without overriding
  
                class Car:
                    def start(self):

                c = ElectricCar()
                c.start()   # prints : spark plug , which doesn't makes sense



                # with overriding
  
                class Car:
                    def start(self):
