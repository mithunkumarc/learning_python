 It is not necessary that the function definition is textually enclosed in the class definition: 
 assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok.
 For example:
 
 def eat(self):
    print(self.name)


class Animal:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    e = eat


a = Animal('tiger')
a.e()



****************************************************************************
avoid creating multiple reference to same function

class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print('eating')

    e = eat


a = Animal()
a.e()
a.eat()

#ouput : e being exactly equivalent to eat. Note that this practice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program.
