 [ ] : Used to indicate a set of characters.
 
 Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.
 
 Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', eg : [a-z] or [0-9A-Za-z]
 
 Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. 
 For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'.
