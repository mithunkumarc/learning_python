#### A Class is also an object, and just like any other object itâ€™s a instance of something called Metaclass.

          class Person:
              pass


          print(type(Person)) # <class 'type'>, class Person is also instance of another class called type

#### A special class type creates these Class object.
#### The type class is default metaclass which is responsible for making classes

          t = Person
          print(isinstance(t,type))   # True


#### Because Classes are also an object, they can be modified in same way.
#### We can add or subtract fields or methods in class in same way we did with other objects.

          
          class Test:
              pass

          Test.count = 100                                         # adding attribute count
          setattr(Test,"square",lambda number : number * number)  # adding function
          print(Test.count)
          print(Test.square(5))
