#### abstract base class : 

            Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) ensure that derived classes implement particular methods from the base class. 

#### without abstract base class

#### agenda :

          object of incomplete class must not be allowed to instantiation
          subclass must implement abstract methods inheriting from parent class


            class Car:
                def start(self):
                    raise NotImplementedError()

            # even though Car has not implemented start(), still its object can be created
            c = Car()


            class ElectricCar(Car):
                pass

            # Class Car not forcing Electric car to implement start method
            e = ElectricCar()



#### using abc module

            from abc import ABCMeta,abstractmethod

            class Car(metaclass=ABCMeta):
                @abstractmethod
                def start(self):
                    raise NotImplementedError()

            # not Car class made as abstract , so Car class cant be instantiated
            # c = Car()

            # class ElectricCar must implement abstract method
            class ElectricCar(Car):
                def start(self):
                    print('use battery')


            e = ElectricCar()
            e.start()
