Sequences are iterables that can return members based on their position within the iterable. these are index based.
      
      strings
      Lists
      Tuples
      Ranges

#### Ranges : 

A range is an immutable sequence of numbers often used in for loops, which will be covered in the Flow Control lesson. 
Ranges are created using range() , which can take one, two, or three arguments:

    range(stop)
    range(start, stop)
    range(start, stop, step)

#### slices are also index based, 

    example : listOfelements[start:stop]
