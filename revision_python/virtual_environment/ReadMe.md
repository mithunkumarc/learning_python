A virtual environment provides a self-contained directory tree with its own Python installation and additional packages necessary for the
project(s) being done in that environment. 
As such, scripts can be run in a virtual environment that have dependencies that are different from those in other development projects that may be running in the
standard environment or in separate virtual environments.

localsystem can have python dependencies globally, but we can use virtual env for saving dependencies required by our python project with specific vertion.
good way to isolate project working env from local system. if local sys update dependencies, we need not to worry about the project.
