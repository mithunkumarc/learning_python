1.open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: open(filename, mode).
2.The first argument is a string containing the filename. 
3.The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. 
4.mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read, 
5.'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), 
and 
6.'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.
7.'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. 
8.The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.


#default mode read
Example : mode : write, 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased)     
# create cities file 
    f = open('cities','w')
    cities = ['bangalore','mysore','tumkur']
    for city in cities:
        f.write(city+'\n')
    f.close()

Example : mode : read, 'r' when the file will only be read
f = open('cities','r')
for i in f.readlines():         # read() function will read single character at a time , readLine() read line by line
    print(i)
    
    
Example : mode w will delete old file, to udate file use mode 'a' for appending file

f = open('cities','a')
cities = ['itanagar','portblair','shimla']
for city in cities:
    f.writelines(city+'\n')
    
    
Example : mode r+ used for both reading and writing into file
f = open('cities','r+')

# for writing
# cities = ['itanagar','portblair','shimla']
# for city in cities:
#     f.writelines(city+'\n')

# for reading
# for city in f.readlines():
#     print(city)
