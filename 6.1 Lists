List being used as stack
# last in first out
stack = [3,4,5]
stack.append(6)
stack.append(7)
print(stack)
print('first out',stack.pop())
print(stack)

# output :
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
('first out', 7)
[3, 4, 5, 6]  # 7 out


Ex : List as queues.
# using Lists as queue
# first in first out
list = [2,3,4]
list.append(5)
list.append(6)
print(list.pop(0))  # removing first element
print(list)


*Note : List is not suitable to implement queue. when you remove first element, removing elements has to
move one step above as list store elements using index
