#### creating  dictionary using dict()

      dict() : accepts list or tuple to create dictionary
                list/tuple must have nested list or tuple with two elements , one for key and another for value
  
      eg  : nested tuple inside list
            m = dict([('1d',100),('2d',200),('3d',300)])
      
            nested list inside tuple
            m = dict((['1d',100],['2d',200], ['3d',300]))
  
      
> don't use set to create  key value pair as set is unordered, values that supposed to be key may become values, viceversa


        m = dict([{'1d',100},{'2d',200},{'3d',300}])
        print(m)
        print(m['2d'])
        
        # output : run many times to see output 
        # {'1d': 100, 200: '2d', '3d': 300}
        # 
        # KeyError: '2d'

        # note use list or tuple, becuase list and tuple are ordered
