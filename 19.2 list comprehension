when we have to choose generator over list? 
ans . while generating large list of data



# using list

 import time
 started = time.time()
 list = [x*2 for x in range(1000000,9000000)]  # list of numbers between 1000000 and 9000000 
 print(time.time()-started)

# output :
# taking 0.62343.. seconds to generate list of numbers*2 between 1000000 and 9000000


# using generator
# generator works on demand , on call of next function ,it gives the next number 
  
  started = time.time()
  generator = (x*2 for x in range(1000000,9000000))   #() indicates generator
  print(time.time()-started)

#takes almost zero time
#taking 0.00000178 seconds to create generator object(not list of numbers)

# print(generator.__next__()), get one by one element by calling next function
