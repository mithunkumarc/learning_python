looping with index

        //works for tuple and set(unordered/cannot expect order) too
        for i,v in enumerate(["one","two","three"]):
            print(i,v)


        0 one
        1 two
        2 three    
        
        

with dict : 

        d = {11:"red",12:'green'}
        for i,v in enumerate(d):
            print(i,v)

         output : only keys

         0 11
        1 12
        
        

to get key and values : 


        d = {11:"red",12:'green'}
        for i,v in enumerate(d.items()):
            print(i,v)

        0 (11, 'red')
        1 (12, 'green')
