python3 stores pyc files in __pycache__ folder

location of __pycache__ folder is same as of source files

lets say we are running test.py module which imports calculator.py module

calculator.pyc file will be generated, no pyc file is created for test mode as it is directly compiled and executed directly.

if you run test.py again, calculator.pyc file will be generated again unless you change the source code of calculator.py


>> same folder 
             test.py
             calculator.py
  
  after running test.py
    
  >> same folder  
            test.py
            calculator.py 
            __pycache__
                    calcualtor.pyc    # only calculator pyc generator because , this file is being imported in test module
                    
                    
   
   
   
   pyc files are created for those modules which are being imported in other modules
